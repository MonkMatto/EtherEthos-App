              Why is it important that I *own* my profile data?
            </h3>
            <p class="px-4 py-4 lg:px-8 lg:py-8">
              Before EtherEthos, you give your data away for free, all the time.
              To every app that asks you to create a profile, from marketplaces
              to social networks. You give up control over that data and entrust
              its security to a centralized entity. Do you think their security
              practices as good as an Ethereum private key??? In addition,
              owning your profile data means that, with EtherEthos adoption, you
              only need to update it, delete it, turn it off, etc. in one place
              - the contract. If you build your EtherEthos, the apps will come
              to you.

              What is composability and why should I care?
            </h3>
            <p class="px-4 py-4 lg:px-8 lg:py-8">
              Composability allows for simple use of data across various apps
              and implementations. It creates opportunities for a more
              streamlined app development, and it creates opportunities for
              better user experience - your experience. I means that smart
              contracts can actually use the data and incorporate it into their
              functions. It creates a more 'open' world to share your data - if
              you want to.

              How can I remove my data?
            </h3>
            <p class="px-4 py-4 lg:px-8 lg:py-8">
              When you write your data to the EtherEthos contract, you create a
              permanent record of that data on-chain. Even if you disable
              composability (turns off live access through the contract) or
              overwrite the data entirely, the initially stored data will still
              exist and still be publicly accessible through blockchain
              explorers. You should not 'dox' yourself on EtherEthos unless
              you're already public about your identity. You should never write
              any personally identifiable information to the contract.

              How does this work with multiple chains?
            </h3>
            <p class="px-4 py-4 lg:px-8 lg:py-8">
              Data on each chain is by default separate - updating data on
              mainnet does not update data on an L2. We are entering a
              multi-layer world though, and on every layer, a user can update a
              timestamp (this is the timestamp ping). Apps that use EtherEthos
              data could search profiles on each supported layer and only pull
              the data from the newest timestamp. In such a scenario, one could
              write data on an L2, and if the timestamp is farther along than
              mainnet, the app would serve the L2's data.

              What is respecting, respect, and notes?
            </h3>
            <p class="px-4 py-4 lg:px-8 lg:py-8">
              EtherEthos evolved from a sort of 'on-chain resume' system, and
              viewing these features in that framework might help. Respecting an
              account shows that a user is publicly showing their respect for
              another. This could simply be used as a social signal, and this
              data is shown on both accounts - the respect giver and receiver.
              In addition, respecting an account gives the respect-receiving
              account permission to write the respect-giving account a note.
              These notes are public and visible on both account's profiles, and
              these can be thought of as professional
              endorsements/recommendations, or just simple notes 'Congrats on
              the launch!'. Given two accounts, A and B, if each account
              respects the other, each account can only write one note for the
              other. This note can be overwritten by the writer, and it can be
              deleted by either party.

              I'm an app/contract dev, and I want to use this data! Where do I
              start?
            </h3>
            <p class="px-4 py-4 lg:px-8 lg:py-8">
              Awesome! First and foremost, understand that it is EtherEthos's
              intention that apps only use live contract data, thereby adhering
              to the composability wishes of every account. If you don't agree
              to that, ask yourself if users will want to use your app when you
              don't respect their wishes. Right? Ok, check out the docs on

              only retrieves data live from chain, and it is a public repo.
              Additionally, there are a growing number of NFT contracts that use
              EtherEthos data, starting with BLONKS. The relevant functions are
              included in this project's documentation.

              Anyone, any service, and any contract can use the EtherEthos

              to EtherEthos.com, the contract, or the dev, @MonkMatto. There are
              costs associated with running this service for free to all
              Ethereum users, and any tips are appreciated at dev.EtherEthos.eth
